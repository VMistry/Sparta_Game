# Sparta Core Project 1(Sparta Game)

## Task
My mission, for the first core project at Sparta Global, was to build a **browser based game!** It was built it using using html, css and JavaScript! This was including jQuery and css framework(Bootstrap).  

The choice of the game was totally up to me to decide, as this was to test out my skills gained within the last two weeks, and maybe challenge myself in to completing the tasks given.

Before creating the website, I had to create 3 different of 3 different games. This was verified by my trainers, who suggested instead of making one browser based game, make 3 in one website.
The games were
* Mind Game(Simon says)
* RPS (Rock, paper, scissors)
* Pillar(Not sure of  real name).

This meant that I had to make sure that..
* All the games had there own website.
* There was a main page.
* All games were working.
* All the games were linked.

Also, I had to follow the normal requirements, which were to...

* Include an instruction section explaining how to play the game.
* Either display a message when the user has won or display the users score after the game has finished.
* Be styled to perfection!
* Be hosted online!
* Your game should include a leaderboard
* Your game should be 2 player

Once we finish the project, we needed to prepare and present what we have made to an audience, which were the other groups of trainees within Sparta Global, as well as my group. This presentation was 5 minutes long and it include powerpoint slides showing what I have do to meet the end result. During the presentation, we were assessed on the quality of our presentation. This meant that I had to make sure that I prepare during the development process to deliver high side deck.
